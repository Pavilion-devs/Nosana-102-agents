### Project Title: **NEXUS ‚Äî AI Agent for IoT Device Monitoring & Control**

---

## üöÄ **1. Overview**

**NEXUS** is a **production-ready AI agent application** that provides **real-time control and monitoring** for IoT devices (e.g., smart plugs, sensors, temperature monitors) through a **Next.js dashboard** powered by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

The system enables users to interact with their connected devices naturally (via chat or voice), while the backend agents handle data interpretation, device management, and synchronization across the UI in real time.

---

## üéØ **2. Problem Statement**

IoT systems today are fragmented ‚Äî users must manage multiple dashboards for different devices or rely on limited native apps.
NEXUS unifies this into a **single AI-driven interface** that:

* Monitors device data in real time
* Automates device control via intelligent agent reasoning
* Provides contextual insights (‚Äúyour room temperature has been rising for 30 minutes; should I turn on the fan?‚Äù)

---

## üí° **3. Solution Summary**

A **Mastra AI agent** (using MCP) connects with a **set of IoT simulators** (or live devices) via APIs or MQTT.
It collects data, manages control commands, and interacts with users through a clean, reactive **Next.js dashboard**.

When a device state changes, the agent updates the UI instantly (bi-directional sync).

üß† Primary Use Case: Smart Energy Management in Homes or Offices

Imagine a smart workspace (or home) equipped with several IoT devices:

Smart lights

Air conditioners

Fans

Temperature sensors

Power sockets

Your NEXUS AI Agent manages all these in real time.

üè† Scenario Example:

The AI agent monitors temperature, occupancy, and device power consumption in real time and automatically adjusts devices to optimize comfort and save energy.

Step-by-Step:

Data Collection

The IoT sensors send live data:

Temperature: 31¬∞C

Room Occupancy: true

Devices: Fan (off), AC (off)

AI Reasoning

The NEXUS agent detects the room is too hot and occupied.

It asks: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs currently 31¬∞C and you‚Äôre in the room. Should I turn on the fan or AC?‚Äù

User Command or Auto-Decision

User says: ‚ÄúTurn on the fan for 10 minutes.‚Äù

The AI turns it on and updates the dashboard instantly.

Real-Time Dashboard

UI shows ‚ÄúFan: ON‚Äù with live power consumption.

Graph shows temperature gradually decreasing.

Automation

After a week of similar behavior, NEXUS suggests:
‚ÄúWould you like me to automatically turn on the fan when the temperature exceeds 30¬∞C while you‚Äôre in the room?‚Äù

Energy Optimization

Monthly report:
‚ÄúYou saved 12% electricity this week by using smart schedules.‚Äù

‚ö° Real-World Use Cases (After the Hackathon)
1. Smart Home Automation

Voice or chat control for all smart devices

Predictive automation (‚Äúturn off lights when no one‚Äôs in the room‚Äù)

Energy dashboards with historical analytics

2. Industrial Equipment Monitoring

Real-time temperature, vibration, or pressure monitoring of machinery

AI alerts when readings exceed safe limits

Preventive maintenance scheduling

3. Agricultural Monitoring

Sensors track soil moisture, temperature, humidity

Agent automatically activates irrigation pumps

Dashboard shows live field data and growth insights

4. Smart Campus / Office Buildings

Detect occupied rooms and optimize lighting or HVAC usage

AI assistant reports daily consumption

Syncs with Google Calendar to pre-cool meeting rooms before events

5. Healthcare & Elderly Care

Monitors air quality, humidity, temperature, and patient activity

Alerts caretakers if conditions become unsafe

Integrates with wearables to ensure comfort and safety

6. Retail / Smart Store Management

Monitors refrigeration units, lighting, and door sensors

AI detects anomalies and suggests cost-saving measures
